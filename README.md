<h1>My FoodBasket Website</h1>

I have created a practical food ordering platform developed with "React" and "Redux" and powered by "json-server," where users can find their favorite restaurants, browse their menus, and place an order. Thanks to "React Router," users can easily browse the menus of different restaurants and add their favorite dishes to the cart. Thanks to the application status managed by "Redux," the cart content and total amount are updated in real time. The application powered by "json-server" dynamically loads restaurant and food information. The interface enriched with "React Icons" makes the user experience more enjoyable.
